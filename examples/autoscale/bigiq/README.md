## Introduction

This solution uses a parent template to launch several linked child templates (modules) to create an example BIG-IP Autoscale solution. The linked templates are located in the [examples/modules](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation-v2/tree/main/examples/modules) directory in this repository. **F5 recommends cloning this repository and modifying these templates to fit your use case.** 

***Full Stack (autoscale.yaml)***<br>
Use the *autoscale.yaml* parent template to deploy an example full stack Autoscale solution, complete with network, bastion *(optional)*, dag/ingress, access, bigip(s), supporting functions, telemetry destination and application.  

***Existing Network Stack (autoscale-existing-network.yaml)***<br>
Use *autoscale-existing-network.yaml* parent template to deploy the Autoscale solution into an existing infrastructure. This template expects VPC, subnets, and bastion host(s) have already been deployed. A demo application is also **NOT** part of this parent template as it intended use is for an existing environment.

The modules below create the following cloud resources:

- **Network**: This template creates AWS VPC and subnets. *(Full stack only)*
- **Bastion**: This template creates a generic example bastion for use when connecting to the management interfaces of BIG-IPs. *(Full stack only)*
- **Application**: This template creates a generic application for use when demonstrating live traffic through the BIG-IP. *(Full stack only)*
- **Disaggregation** *(DAG)*: This template creates resources required to get traffic to the BIG-IP, including AWS Security Groups, Public IP Addresses, internal/external Load Balancers, and accompanying resources such as load balancing rules, NAT rules, and probes.
- **Access**: This template creates IAM Roles, AWS InstanceProfiles and ssh keys.
- **BIG-IP**: This template creates the AWS Autoscale Group with F5 BIG-IP Virtual Editions provisioned with Local Traffic Manager (LTM) and Application Security Manager (ASM). Traffic flows from the AWS load balancer to the BIG-IP VE instances and then to the application servers. The BIG-IP VE(s) are configured in single-NIC mode. Auto scaling means that as certain thresholds are reached, the number of BIG-IP VE instances automatically increases or decreases accordingly. The BIG-IP module template can be deployed separately from the example template provided here into an "existing" stack.
- **Function**: This template creates AWS Lambda functions for revoking licenses from BIG-IP instances that were licensed using a BIG-IQ license pool or utility offer *(BIG-IQ only)*, looking up AMI by name, file cleanup, etc.
- **Telemetry**: This template creates resources to support sending metrics and remote logging (for example, an S3 Bucket or AWS CloudWatch Log Group, Log Stream and Dashboard). 


This solution leverages more traditional Autoscale configuration management practices where each instance is created with an identical configuration as defined in the Autoscale Group's "model" (i.e. "launch config"). Scale Max sizes are no longer restricted to the small limitations of the cluster. The BIG-IP's configuration, now defined in a single convenient YAML or JSON [F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init) configuration file, leverages [F5 Automation Tool Chain](https://www.f5.com/pdf/products/automation-toolchain-overview.pdf) declarations which are easier to author, validate, and maintain as code. For instance, if you need to change the configuration on the BIG-IPs in the deployment, you update the instance model by passing a new config file (which references the updated Automation Toolchain declarations) via the template's bigIpRuntimeInitConfig input parameter. New instances will be deployed with the updated configurations.  


## Diagram

![Configuration Example](diagrams/diagram.png)
## Prerequisites

- A location to host your custom BIG-IP config (runtime-init.conf) with your BIG-IQ LM and logging information. See [Changing the BIG-IP Deployment](#changing-the-big-ip-deployment) for customization details.

- A BIG-IQ with License Manager (LM) configured with a valid license pool that is reachable by the BIG-IP system. See the [documentation](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K77706009) for more details. ***NOTE: For this example solution, "reachable" implies the BIG-IQ LM has a Public IP and is reachable over the Internet. However, in a production deployment, the BIG-IQ would be internally routable (for example, with shared services VPC, VPN, etc.)***

- A secret stored in AWS [Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) containing the password to use to obtain a license from BIG-IQ.
    ```bash
    # secret-string in single quotes to avoid bash special character interpolation
    aws secretsmanager create-secret --region ${REGION} --name ${YOUR_SECRET_NAME} --secret-string 'YOUR_BIGIQ_PASSWORD'
    ```
  - *NOTE: You will need both the Name/ID (for example, 'myBigIqSecret') and ARN (for example, 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:111111111111:secret:myBigIqSecret-xdg0kdf').*

- Accepted the EULA for the F5 image in the AWS marketplace. If you have not deployed BIG-IP VE in your environment before, search for F5 in the Marketplace and then click **Accept Software Terms**. This only appears the first time you attempt to launch an F5 image. By default, this solution deploys the [F5 BIG-IP VE - ALL (BYOL, 2 Boot Locations)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-73utu5c5sfyyc) images. For more information, see [K14810: Overview of BIG-IP VE license and throughput limits](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K14810).

- You need the appropriate permission in AWS to launch CloudFormation Templates (CFT). You must be using an IAM user with the Administrator Access policy attached and have permission to create the objects contained in this solution (VPCs, Routes, EIPs, EC2 Instances, etc.). For details on permissions and all AWS configuration, see [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/). 
- Sufficient **EC2 Resources** to deploy this solution. For more information, see AWS resource limit [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html).


## Important Configuration Notes

-  This solution requires you to customize and host your own runtime-init configurations. For your customized the Runtime Configurations, use the **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** input parameter to specify the new location of the BIG-IP Runtime-Init config. See [Changing the BIG-IP Deployment](#changing-the-big-ip-deployment) for more BIG-IP customization details.

- To change the BIG-IP image, update the  **bigIpImage** parameter. See [Understanding AMI Lookup Function](../../modules/function/README.md#understanding-ami-lookup-function) for valid string options. For non marketplace custom images (for example clones, or those created by the [F5 BIG-IP Image Generator](https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-bigip-image-generator/)), update the **bigIpCustomImageId** parameter.

- By default, this solution configures an SSH Key pair in AWS for management access to BIG-IP VE via the **sshKey** parameter. For more information about creating and/or importing the key pair in AWS, see [AWS SSH key documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html). If one is not specified, one will be created for you named `uniqueString-keyPair` *(where `uniqueString` is the value you provided in the **uniqueString** parameter)*. To obtain the private key, refer to AWS section [To retrieve the private key in plain text](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-keypair.html). 
  - For example, you first obtain the key pair ID.
    - If using the AWS Management Console, navigate to *EC2 > Key Pairs > uniqueString-keyPair > ID column*.
    - If using the AWS CLI, you can run the following aws cli [command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-key-pairs.html), replacing uniqueString and region with your values:
      ```bash
      aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --key-name ${UNIQUE_STRING}-keyPair --query KeyPairs[*].KeyPairId --output text --region ${REGION}
      ```
  - Then you can use the key pair ID to obtain the private key:
    - If using the AWS Management Console, navigate to *Systems Manager > Parameter Store > click on your /ec2/keypair/${KEY_ID} -> click Show*
    - If using the AWS CLI, you can run the following aws cli [command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/get-parameter.html), replacing the key id and region with your values:
      ```bash
      aws ssm get-parameter --name "/ec2/keypair/${KEY_ID}" --with-decryption --query Parameter.Value --output text --region ${REGION}
      ```
  - For more information about accessing the instances with a SSH private key, see Accessing the BIG-IP [below](#ssh). 

- By default, this solution creates required IAM roles, policies, and instance profile. By specifying a value for the **bigIpInstanceProfile** input parameter, you can assign a pre-existing IAM instance profile with applied IAM policy to the BIG-IP instance(s).  See AWS IAM [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/getting-started-create-iam-instance-profile.html) for more information on creating these resources. Ensure it contains the required permissions for the secret provided with **bigIqSecretArn**. See [IAM Permissions by Solution Type](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation-v2/tree/main/examples/modules/access#iam-permissions-by-solution-type) for a detailed list of the permissions required by this solution.

- If you have cloned this repository to modify the templates or BIG-IP config files and published to your own location (NOTE: CloudFormation can only reference S3 bucket locations for templates and not generic URLs like from GitHub), you can use the **s3BucketName**, **s3BucketRegion** and **artifactLocation** input parameters to specify the new location of the customized templates. You may also need to ensure that the user has READ IAM permissions to that bucket. See main [/examples/README.md](../README.md#cloud-configuration) for more template customization details.

- By default, the example runtime-init configs do not create a password authenticated BIG-IP user as it follows the immutable model (in other words, individual instances are not meant to be actively managed post-deployment, and configuration is instead defined through the model). However, sshKey is required here to provide minimal admin access. 
   -  **Disclaimer:** ***Accessing or logging into the instances themselves is for demonstration and debugging purposes only. All configuration changes should be applied by updating the model via the template instead. See [Changing the BIG-IP Deployment](#changing-the-big-ip-deployment) for more details.***

- In the autoscale model, instances are ephemeral so remote logging is required. By default, this example logs to CloudWatch and creates a Log Group, Log Stream and Dashboard. This solution sends metrics and logs to the following CloudWatch destinations: 
  - metricsNamespace: f5-scaling-metrics 
  - logGroup: f5telemetry
  - logstream: f5-waf-logs

  The default metrics and logging values in this template can only be used once per account as CloudWatch resources must be unique. To deploy more than one of these per account, you must supply unique values for the metricNameSpace, cloudWatchLogGroupName, and cloudWatchLogStreamName input parameters. There also are many possible logging destinations. See AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Working-with-log-groups-and-streams.html) and [Changing the BIG-IP Deployment](#changing-the-big-ip-deployment) for more details.

- This solution requires Internet Access for: 
    - Downloading additional F5 software components used for onboarding and configuring the BIG-IP (via GitHub.com). By default, and as a convenience, this solution provisions Public IPs to enable this, but in a production environment outbound access should be provided by a `routed` SNAT service (for example NAT Gateway, custom firewall, etc.). *NOTE: access via web proxy is not currently supported. Other options include 1) hosting the file locally and modifying the runtime-init package URL and configuration files to point to local URLs instead or 2) baking them into a custom image, using the [F5 Image Generation Tool](https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/ve-image-gen_index.html) (BYOL only).*
    - Contacting native cloud services (ex. s3.amazonaws.com, ec2.amazonaws.com, etc.) for various cloud integrations: 
    - *Onboarding*:
        - [F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init](https://github.com/f5networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init) - to fetch secrets from native vault services
    - *Operation*:
        - [F5 Application Services 3](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/) - for features like Service Discovery
        - [F5 Telemetry Streaming](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/) - for logging and reporting
      - Additional cloud services like [VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints.html) can be used to address calls to native services traversing the Internet.
  - See [Security](#security) section for more details. 

- In this solution, the BIG-IP VE has the [LTM](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) and [ASM](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/application-security-manager-asm) modules enabled to provide advanced traffic management and web application security functionality. 

- This solution has specifically been tested in AWS Commercial Cloud. Additional cloud environments such as AWS China cloud have not yet been tested.

- This template can send non-identifiable statistical information to F5 Networks to help us improve our templates. You can disable this functionality for this deployment only by supplying **false** for the value of the **allowUsageAnalytics** input parameter, or you can disable it system-wide by setting the **autoPhonehome** system class property value to false in the F5 Declarative Onboarding declaration. See [Sending statistical information to F5](#sending-statistical-information-to-f5).

- See [Troubleshooting steps](#troubleshooting-steps) for more details.

### Changing the BIG-IP Deployment


For Bring Your Own License (BYOL) deployments, you will need to change the BIG-IP configuration. This involves customizing the licensing portion of Declarative Onboarding declaration in [F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init](https://github.com/f5networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init) configuration file, republishing/rehosting it, and passing a new URL through the **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** template parameter.

Example from autoscale-parameters.json
```json
  {
    "ParameterKey": "bigIpRuntimeInitConfig",
    "ParameterValue": "https://f5-cft-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/f5-aws-cloudformation-v2/v2.7.0.0/examples/autoscale/bigip-configurations/runtime-init-conf-bigiq-with-app.yaml"
  },
```

**IMPORTANT**: Any URLs pointing to git **must** use the raw file format (for example, "raw.githubusercontent.com").

F5 has provided the following example configuration files in the `examples/autoscale/bigip-configurations` folder:

- `runtime-init-conf-bigiq-with-app.yaml` - This configuration file installs packages and creates WAF-protected services for a BIG-IQ licensed deployment based on the Automation Toolchain declaration URLs listed above.
- `runtime-init-conf-payg-with-app.yaml` - This inline configuration file installs packages and creates WAF-protected services for a PAYG licensed deployment.
- `Rapid_Deployment_Policy_13_1.xml` - This ASM security policy is supported for BIG-IP 13.1 and later.

See [F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init](https://github.com/f5networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init) for more examples.

**IMPORTANT**: 
By default, this solution references the `runtime-init-conf-bigiq-with-app.yaml` example BIG-IP config file.
  - The **Full Stack** *(autoscale.yaml)* always **requires** customizing this file with your BIG-IQ Licensing configuration.
  - The **Existing Network Stack** *(autoscale-existing-network.yaml)* always **requires** customizing this file (with your BIG-IQ Licensing **AND** Virtual Service configuration pointing at your own application) and republishing before deploying.
  
**Example Customization 1:**

To change the BIG-IQ Licensing configuration:

  1. Edit/modify the Declarative Onboarding (DO) declaration in the runtime-init config file [runtime-init-conf-bigiq-with-app.yaml](../bigip-configurations/runtime-init-conf-bigiq-with-app.yaml) with the new `License` values. 

      Example:
      ```yaml
                My_License:
                  class: License
                  hypervisor: aws
                  licenseType: <YOUR_LICENSE_TYPE>
                  licensePool: <YOUR_LICENSE_POOL>
                  bigIqHost: <YOUR_BIG_IQ_HOST>
                  bigIqUsername: <YOUR_BIG_IQ_USERNAME>
                  bigIqPassword: '{{{BIGIQ_PASSWORD}}}'
                  tenant: <YOUR_TENANT>
                  skuKeyword1: <YOUR_SKU_KEYWORD>
                  unitOfMeasure: <YOUR_UNIT_OF_MEASURE>
                  reachable: false
      ```
  3. Publish/host the customized runtime-init config file at a location reachable by the BIG-IP at deploy time (for example, git, S3, etc.).
  4. Update the **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** input parameter to reference the URL of the customized configuration file.
  5. Update the **bigIqSecretArn** input parameter with the ARN that corresponds to the BIG-IQ password as well as the other required BIG-IQ related input parameters to match.
      - **bigIqAddressType**
      - **bigIqSecurityGroupId**
      - **bigIqSubnetId**


**Example Customization 2:**

To change the Virtual Service configuration:
  1. Edit/modify the Application Services 3 (AS3) declaration in the example runtime-init config file ` [runtime-init-conf-payg-with-app.yaml](../bigip-configurations/runtime-init-conf-payg-with-app.yaml) to point at your own application. 

      Example: At a minimum, update the Pool class:
      ```yaml
                  shared_pool:
                    class: Pool
                    remark: Service 1 shared pool
                    members:
                      - servicePort: 80
                        addressDiscovery: aws
                        region: '{{{REGION}}}'
                        updateInterval: 60
                        tagKey: 'aws:cloudformation:logical-id'
                        tagValue: appAutoscaleGroup
                        addressRealm: private
                    monitors:
                      - http
      ```
      with: 
      ```yaml
                  shared_pool:
                    class: Pool
                    remark: Service 1 shared pool
                    members:
                      - servicePort: 80
                        addressDiscovery: aws
                        region: '{{{REGION}}}'
                        updateInterval: 60
                        tagKey: <TAG KEY ON YOUR APPLICATION>
                        tagValue: <TAG VALUE ON YOUR APPLICATION>
                        addressRealm: private
                    monitors:
                      - http
      ```
      Or even with another pool configuration entirely. For example, using the [FQDN](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/declarations/discovery.html#using-an-fqdn-pool-to-identify-pool-members) Service Discovery instead to point to a DNS name.

      Example:
      ```yaml
                      class: Pool
                      remark: Service 1 shared pool
                      members:
                      - addressDiscovery: fqdn
                        autoPopulate: true
                        hostname: <WWW.YOURSITE.COM>
                        servicePort: 80
      ```

      See AS3 [documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/userguide/composing-a-declaration.html) for more details and examples.

  3. Publish/host the customized runtime-init config file at a location reachable by the BIG-IP at deploy time (for example, S3, git, etc.).
  4. Update the **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** input parameter to reference the URL of the customized configuration file.

**Example Customization 3:**

By default, this solution sends metrics and logs to the following CloudWatch destinations: 
  - metricsNamespace: f5-scaling-metrics 
  - logGroup: f5telemetry
  - logstream: f5-waf-logs

To log to an S3 Bucket instead:
  1. Ensure target S3 Logging destination exists in same region. See AWS's [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-buckets-s3.html) for more information.
  2. Edit/modify the Telemetry Streaming (TS) declaration in the example runtime-init config file in the corresponding `bigiq` [runtime-init-conf-bigiq-with-app.yaml](../bigip-configurations/runtime-init-conf-bigiq-with-app.yaml) with the new `Telemetry_Consumer` configuration.

      Example: Replace 
      ```yaml
              My_Cloudwatch_Logs:
                class: Telemetry_Consumer
                type: AWS_CloudWatch
                region: '{{{REGION}}}'
                logGroup: f5telemetry
                logStream: f5-waf-logs
      ```
      with: 
      ```yaml
              My_S3_Logs:
                class: Telemetry_Consumer
                type: AWS_S3
                region: '{{{REGION}}}'
                bucket: <YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>
      ```
  3. Publish/host the customized runtime-init config file at a location reachable by the BIG-IP at deploy time (for example, git, S3, etc.).
  4. Update the **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** input parameter to reference the URL of the customized configuration file.
  5. Update the **loggingS3BucketName** input parameter with name of your logging destination. An IAM role will be created with permissions to log to that bucket.


To log to another remote destination that may require authentication:
  1. Edit/modify the `runtime_parameters:` in the runtime-init config file to ADD a secret. If a secret is provided via the **bigIpSecretArn** parameter, it will made available on the BIG-IP via a file called `/config/cloud/secret_id`. For example: Add the section below. 

      ```yaml
        - name: SECRET_ID
          type: url
          value: file:///config/cloud/secret_id
        - name: LOGGING_API_KEY
          type: secret
          secretProvider:
            type: SecretsManager
            environment: aws
            version: AWSCURRENT
            secretId: '{{{SECRET_ID}}}'
      ```
  2. Edit/modify the Telemetry Streaming (TS) declaration in the example runtime-init config with the new `Telemetry_Consumer` configuration, replacing `<YOUR_HOST>` with value for your host.

      ```yaml
              My_Consumer:
                class: Telemetry_Consumer
                type: Splunk
                host: <YOUR_HOST>
                protocol: https
                port: 8088
                passphrase:
                  cipherText: '{{{LOGGING_API_KEY}}}'
                compressionType: gzip
      ```
  3. Publish/host the customized runtime-init config file at a location reachable by the BIG-IP at deploy time (for example, S3, git, etc.).
  4. Update the **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** input parameter to reference the URL of the customized configuration file.
  5. Update the **bigIpSecretArn** input parameter with the ARN of your logging secret. 
     - An IAM role will be created with permissions to fetch that secret.


## Validation

This section describes how to validate the template deployment, test the WAF service, and troubleshoot common problems.

### Validating the Deployment

To view the status of the example and module stack deployments in the AWS Console, navigate to **CloudFormation > Stacks > *Your stack name***. You should see a series of stacks, including one for the Parent Quickstart template as well as the Network, Application, DAG, and BIG-IP nested templates. The creation status for each stack deployment should be "CREATE_COMPLETE". 

Expected Deploy time for entire stack =~ 15 minutes.

If any of the stacks are in a failed state, proceed to the [Troubleshooting Steps](#troubleshooting-steps) section below.


### Testing the WAF Service

To test the WAF service, perform the following steps:
1. Obtain the address of the WAF service:
    - **Console**: Navigate to **CloudFormation > *STACK_NAME* > Outputs > wafExternalHttpsUrl**.
    - **AWS CLI**: 
      ```bash
      aws cloudformation describe-stacks --region ${REGION} --stack-name ${STACK_NAME}  --query  "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='wafExternalHttpsUrl'].OutputValue" --output text
      ```

2. Verify the application is responding:
    - Paste the address in a browser: ```https://${IP_ADDRESS_FROM_OUTPUT}```
      - NOTE: By default, the Virtual Service starts with a self-signed certificate. Follow your browser's instructions for accepting self-signed certs (For example, if using Chrome, click inside the page and type this "thisisunsafe". If using Firefox, click the "Advanced" button, click "Accept Risk and Continue", etc. ).
    - Use curl: 
      ```shell
       curl -sko /dev/null -w '%{response_code}\n' https://${IP_ADDRESS_FROM_OUTPUT}
       ```

3. Verify the WAF is configured to block illegal requests:
    ```shell
    curl -sk -X DELETE https://${IP_ADDRESS_FROM_OUTPUT}
    ```
    The response should include a message that the request was blocked, and a reference support ID. For example:
    ```shell
    $ curl -sko /dev/null -w '%{response_code}\n' https://55.55.55.55
    200
    $ curl -sk -X DELETE https://55.55.55.55
    <html><head><title>Request Rejected</title></head><body>The requested URL was rejected. Please consult with your administrator.<br><br>Your support ID is: 2394594827598561347<br><br><a href='javascript:history.back();'>[Go Back]</a></body></html>
    ```

### Viewing the CloudWatch Dashboard

 - If left at the defaults, a CloudWatch Dashboard named "F5-BIGIP-WAF-View" is created. 
    - **Console**: Navigate to **CloudWatch > *DASHBOARD_NAME***.
      - Review any violations.
      

### Accessing the BIG-IP

As mentioned in [Configuration notes](#important-configuration-notes), by default, this solution does not create a password authenticated user and accessing or logging into the instances themselves is for demonstration or debugging purposes only.

From Template Outputs:
  - **Console**: Navigate to **CloudFormation > *STACK_NAME* > Outputs**.
  - **AWS CLI**: 
      ```bash
      aws cloudformation describe-stacks --region ${REGION} --stack-name ${STACK_NAME}  --query  "Stacks[0].Outputs"
      ```

  - Obtain an Instance ID of one of the instances from the BIG-IP Autoscale Group:
    - **Console**:
      - Navigate to **CloudFormation > *STACK_NAME* > Outputs > *bigIpAutoscaleGroupName***. 
      - Navigate to **EC2 > Autos Scaling Groups > *bigIpAutoscaleGroupName* > Instance Management**
    - **AWS CLI**: 
        ```bash
        aws cloudformation describe-stacks --region ${REGION} --stack-name ${STACK_NAME} --query  "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='bigIpAutoscaleGroupName'].OutputValue" --output text
        ```
        ```bash
        aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --region ${REGION} --auto-scaling-group-name ${bigIpAutoscaleGroup} --query 'AutoScalingGroups[*].Instances[*]'
        ```

  - Obtain the Public IP address of the BIG-IP Management Port:
      - **Console**: Navigate to **EC2 > Instances > *INSTANCE_ID* > Instance Summary > Public IPv4 address**.
      - **AWS CLI**: 
        - Public IPs: 
            ```bash
            aws ec2 describe-instances --region ${REGION} --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" "Name=instance-id,Values=${INSTANCE_ID}" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[PublicIpAddress]' --output text
            ```

  - Or if you are going through a bastion host (when **provisionPublicIP** = **false**):
      - Follow steps above for the BIG-IP but substitute **bigIpAutoscaleGroup** with **bastionAutoscaleGroupName** 
         - Obtain an Instance ID of one of the Bastion Host instances
         - Obtain the Public IP of the Bastion Host instance

       - Obtain the Private IP address of the bigip host instead: 
         -  **Console**: Navigate to **EC2 > Instances > *INSTANCE_ID* > Instance Summary > Public IPv4 address**.
         -  **AWS CLI**: 
         - Private IPs: 
              ```bash
              aws ec2 describe-instances --region ${REGION} --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" "Name=instance-id,Values=${INSTANCE_ID}" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[PrivateIpAddress]' --output text
              ```
#### SSH

  - **SSH key authentication**: 
      ```bash
      # (Optional) If you did not provide the name of an existing SSH key pair, you must retrieve the private key before connecting
      REGION=us-east-1
      UNIQUE_STRING=myuniqstr
      YOUR_PRIVATE_SSH_KEY=${UNIQUE_STRING}-private-key.pem

      # Retrieve the key pair ID
      KEY_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --key-name ${UNIQUE_STRING}-keyPair --query KeyPairs[*].KeyPairId --output text --region ${REGION})
      # Uses key Pair ID to retrieve the private key and save to a file for SSH client
      aws ssm get-parameter --name "/ec2/keypair/${KEY_ID}" --with-decryption --query Parameter.Value --output text --region ${REGION} > ${YOUR_PRIVATE_SSH_KEY}
      # Set the permissions on the private key file for SSH client
      chmod 400 ${YOUR_PRIVATE_SSH_KEY}
      
      # Key is now ready to use for SSH client
      ssh admin@${IP_ADDRESS_FROM_OUTPUT} -i ${YOUR_PRIVATE_SSH_KEY}
      ```

    - OR if you are going through a bastion host (when **provisionPublicIP** = **false**):

        From your desktop client/shell, create an SSH tunnel:
        ```bash
        ssh -i ${YOUR_PRIVATE_SSH_KEY} -o ProxyCommand="ssh -i ${YOUR_PRIVATE_SSH_KEY} -W %h:%p ubuntu@[BASTION-HOST-PUBLIC-IP]" admin@[BIG-IP-MGMT-PRIVATE-IP]
        ```

        Replace the variables in brackets before submitting the command.

        For example:
        ```bash
        ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pem -o ProxyCommand="ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pem -W %h:%p ubuntu@34.82.102.190" admin@10.0.1.11

#### WebUI 

- Login in via WebUI:
  - As mentioned above, no password is configured by default. If you would like or need to login to the GUI for debugging or inspection, you can create a custom username/password by logging in to admin account via SSH (per above) and use TMSH to create one:
    At the TMSH prompt ```admin@(bigip1)(cfg-sync Standalone)(Active)(/Common)(tmos)#```:
      ```shell
      create auth user <YOUR_WEBUI_USERNAME> password <YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD> partition-access add { all-partitions { role admin } }

      save sys config
      ```

  - Open a browser to the Management IP
    - ```https://${IP_ADDRESS_FROM_OUTPUT}:8443```


    - OR when you are going through a bastion host (when **provisionPublicIP** = **false**):

        From your desktop client/shell, create an SSH tunnel:
        ```bash
        ssh -i [keyname-passed-to-template.pem] ubuntu@[BASTION-HOST-PUBLIC-IP] -L 8443:[BIG-IP-MGMT-PRIVATE-IP]:[BIGIP-GUI-PORT]
        ```
        For example:
        ```bash
        ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pem ubuntu@34.82.102.190 -L 8443:10.0.1.11:8443
        ```

        You should now be able to open a browser to the BIG-IP UI from your desktop:

        https://localhost:8443


  - NOTE: 
    - By default, for Single NIC deployments, the management port is 8443.
    - By default, the BIG-IP's WebUI starts with a self-signed cert. Follow your browsers instructions for accepting self-signed certs (for example, if using Chrome, click inside the page and type this "thisisunsafe". If using Firefox, click "Advanced" button, Click "Accept Risk and Continue" ).

  - To Login: 
    - username: `<YOUR_WEBUI_USERNAME>`
    - password: `<YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD>`

### Further Exploring

#### WebUI
 - Navigate to **Virtual Services**. 
    - From the drop-down menu named **Partition**, select Partition = `Tenant_1`
    - Navigate to **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers**. You should see two Virtual Services (one for HTTP and one for HTTPS). This should show up as Green. Click on them to look at the configuration *(declared in the AS3 declaration)*.

#### SSH

  - From TMSH shell, type 'bash' to enter the bash shell
    - Examine BIG-IP configuration via [F5 Automation Toolchain](https://www.f5.com/pdf/products/automation-toolchain-overview.pdf) declarations:
    ```bash
    curl -u admin: http://localhost:8100/mgmt/shared/declarative-onboarding | jq .
    curl -u admin: http://localhost:8100/mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare | jq .
    curl -u admin: http://localhost:8100/mgmt/shared/telemetry/declare | jq . 
    ```
  - Examine the Runtime-Init Config downloaded: 
    ```bash 
    cat /config/cloud/runtime-init.conf
    ```

## Updating this Solution

As mentioned in the [Introduction](#introduction), this solution leverages more traditional Autoscale configuration management practices where the entire configuration and lifecycle of each instance is exclusively managed via the Autoscale Group's "model" (i.e. "launch config"). If you need to change the configuration on the BIG-IP in the deployment, you can update the instance model by passing a new config file via template's **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** input parameter. New instances will be deployed with the updated configurations according the Rolling Update Policy.

To update the BIG-IP configuration:

  1. Edit/modify the runtime-init config file. 
  2. Publish/host the customized runtime-init config file at a location reachable by the BIG-IP at deploy time (for example, git, S3, etc.).
  3. Update the **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** input parameter to reference the new URL of the updated configuration file.
      For example, if versioning with git tag:
      - ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myAccount/myRepo/0.0.1/runtime-init.conf```
      
      to
      - ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myAccount/myRepo/0.0.2/runtime-init.conf```
  4. Update the CloudFormation Stack with the new **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** parameter:
      ```bash
      aws cloudformation update-stack --region ${REGION} --stack-name ${STACK_NAME} \
        --template-url https://f5-cft-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/f5-aws-cloudformation-v2/v2.7.0.0/examples/autoscale/bigiq/autoscale.yaml \
        --parameters "ParameterKey=bigIpRuntimeInitConfig,ParameterValue=https://<YOUR_NEW_LOCATION> ParameterKey=<KEY>,ParameterValue=<VALUE>"
      ```

All lifecycle elements are now managed by the model as well. For example:

To update the BIG-IP OS version:
  1. Update the CloudFormation Stack with new **imageName** parameter:
      ```bash
      aws cloudformation update-stack --region ${REGION} --stack-name ${STACK_NAME} \
        --template-url https://f5-cft-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/f5-aws-cloudformation-v2/v2.7.0.0/examples/autoscale/bigiq/autoscale.yaml \
        --parameters "ParameterKey=imageName,ParameterValue=${imageName} ParameterKey=<KEY>,ParameterValue=<VALUE>"
      ```

To update the BIG-IP instance size:

  2. Update the CloudFormation Stack with new **instanceType** parameter:
      ```bash
      aws cloudformation update-stack --region ${REGION} --stack-name ${STACK_NAME} \
        --template-url https://f5-cft-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/f5-aws-cloudformation-v2/v2.7.0.0/examples/autoscale/bigiq/autoscale.yaml \
        --parameters "ParameterKey=instanceSize,ParameterValue=${instanceType} ParameterKey=<KEY>,ParameterValue=<VALUE>"
      ```

See [Launch Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/LaunchConfiguration.html) and [Rolling Update](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatepolicy.html#cfn-attributes-updatepolicy-rollingupdate) documentation for more information.


## Deleting this Solution


#### Deleting this Solution using the AWS Console

1. Navigate to **CloudFormation > Stacks**.
2. Select the radio button to highlight Parent Template.
3. Click **Delete**.
4. At the confirm pop up, click **Delete Stack**.

#### Deleting this Solution using the AWS CLI

```
 aws cloudformation delete-stack --region ${REGION} --stack-name ${STACK_NAME}
```

### Delete CloudWatch Log Groups created by Lambda functions

By default, this solution creates log groups with the following naming convention

    - ```/aws/lambda/<STACK_NAME>-Function-<UNIQUE_STACK_STRING>-LambdaBigIqRevoke-<UNIQUE_OBJECT_STRING>``` 
    - ```/aws/lambda/<STACK_NAME>-Function-<UNIQUE_STACK_STRING>-AMIInfoFunction-<UNIQUE_OBJECT_STRING>``` 
    - ```/aws/lambda/<STACK_NAME>-Function-<UNIQUE_STACK_STRING>-CopyZipsFunction-<UNIQUE_OBJECT_STRING>``` 
    - ```/aws/lambda/<STACK_NAME>-Function-<UNIQUE_STACK_STRING>-LambdaDeploymentCleanup-<UNIQUE_OBJECT_STRING>``` 

that are not [deleted](https://github.com/aws/serverless-application-model/issues/1216) when the stack is deleted. 


#### Deleting Log Groups using the AWS Console

1. Navigate to **CloudWatch > Log groups**.
2. Use the filter bar to filter for Log Groups with your stack name:
    ```bash
    /aws/lambda/${STACK_NAME}-Function
    ``` 
    For example:
    ```bash
    /aws/lambda/mywaf-Function
    ```
3. Select the radio button to highlight the Log Group(s).
4. Click **Actions** menu button.
5. Select **Delete Log Group(s)**

#### Deleting Log groups using the AWS CLI

```bash
aws logs delete-log-group --region ${REGION} --log-group-name ${LOG_GROUP_NAME}
```

Example: simple bash loop to first LIST all log groups from a stack named "mywaf":
```bash
LOG_GROUPS_TO_SEARCH='/aws/lambda/mywaf-Function'; for i in $(aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix ${LOG_GROUPS_TO_SEARCH} --query logGroups[].logGroupName --output text); do echo "Log Group: ${i}"; done
```

Example: simple bash loop to DELETE all log groups from a stack named "mywaf":
```bash
LOG_GROUPS_TO_SEARCH='/aws/lambda/mywaf-Function'; for i in $(aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix ${LOG_GROUPS_TO_SEARCH} --query logGroups[].logGroupName --output text); do echo "Deleting Log Group: ${i}"; aws logs delete-log-group --log-group-name ${i}; done
```

## Troubleshooting Steps

There are generally two classes of issues:

1. Stack creation itself failed.
2. Resource(s) within the stack failed to deploy.

If a template in the stack failed, click on the name of a failed stack and then click **Events**. Check the **Status Reason** column for the failed event for details about the cause. 

**When creating a GitHub issue for a template, please include as much information as possible from the failed CloudFormation stack events.**

Common deployment failure causes include:
- Required fields were left empty or contained incorrect values (input type mismatch, prohibited characters, etc.) causing template validation failure.
- Insufficient permissions to create the deployment or resources created by a deployment (IAM roles, etc.).
- Resource limitations (exceeded limit of IP addresses or compute resources, etc.).
- AWS service issues. Service health can be checked from the AWS [Service Health Dashboard](https://status.aws.amazon.com/).

If all stacks were created "successfully" but maybe the BIG-IP or Service is not reachable, then log in to the BIG-IP instance via SSH to confirm BIG-IP deployment was successful (for example, if startup scripts completed as expected on the BIG-IP). To verify BIG-IP deployment, perform the following steps:
- Obtain the IP address of the BIG-IP instance. See instructions [above](#accessing-the-bigip-ip).
- Check startup-script to make sure was installed/interpolated correctly:
  - ```cat /opt/cloud/instance/user-data.txt```
- Check the logs (in order of invocation):
  - cloud-init Logs:
    - */var/log/boot.log*
    - */var/log/cloud-init.log*
    - */var/log/cloud-init-output.log*
  - runtime-init Logs:
    - */var/log/cloud/startup-script.log*: This file contains events that happen prior to execution of f5-bigip-runtime-init. If the files required by the deployment fail to download, for example, you will see those events logged here.
    - */var/log/cloud/bigIpRuntimeInit.log*: This file contains events logged by the f5-bigip-runtime-init onboarding utility. If the configuration is invalid, causing onboarding to fail, you will see those events logged here. If deployment is successful, you will see an event with the body "All operations completed successfully".
  - Automation Tool Chain Logs:
    - */var/log/restnoded/restnoded.log*: This file contains events logged by the F5 Automation Toolchain components. If an Automation Toolchain declaration fails to deploy, you will see more details for those events logged here.
- *GENERAL LOG TIP*: Search most critical error level errors first (for example, ``egrep -i err /var/log/<Logname>``).


If you are unable to login to the BIG-IP instance, you can navigate to **EC2 > Instances**, select the check box next to the instance you want to troubleshoot, and then click **Actions > Monitor and Troubleshoot > Get System Log** or **Get Instance Screenshot** for potential logging to serial console.

```bash
aws ec2 get-console-output --region ${REGION}  --instance-id ${INSTANCE_ID}
```

If Licenses are not revoked from BIG-IQ after scaling down, check the Revoke Function's logs in CloudWatch.

- Log Groups
  - Click on Log Group
    ```bash
    /aws/lambda/${STACK_NAME}-Function-<UNIQUE-STACK-STRING>-LambdaBigIqRevoke-<UNIQUE-OBJECT-STRING>
    ``` 
    ex. 
    ```bash
    /aws/lambda/mywaf-Function-1BFXP4VCXHV-LambdaBigIqRevoke-1QLU68ANVLHLO
    ```


## Security

This CloudFormation template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IP system:

- f5-bigip-runtime-init.gz.run: The self-extracting installer for the F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init RPM can be verified against a SHA256 checksum provided as a release asset on the F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init public GitHub repository, for example: https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init/releases/download/1.3.2/f5-bigip-runtime-init-1.3.2-1.gz.run.sha256.
- F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init: The self-extracting installer script extracts, verifies, and installs the F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init RPM package. Package files are signed by F5 and automatically verified using GPG.
- F5 Automation Toolchain components: F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init downloads, installs, and configures the F5 Automation Toolchain components. Although it is optional, F5 recommends adding the extensionHash field to each extension install operation in the configuration file. The presence of this field triggers verification of the downloaded component package checksum against the provided value. The checksum values are published as release assets on each extension's public GitHub repository, for example: https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-appsvcs-extension/releases/download/v3.30.0/f5-appsvcs-3.30.0-5.noarch.rpm.sha256

The following configuration file will verify the Declarative Onboarding and Application Services extensions before configuring AS3 from a local file:

```yaml
runtime_parameters: []
extension_packages:
    install_operations:
        - extensionType: do
          extensionVersion: 1.23.0
          extensionHash: bfe88c7cf3fdb24adc4070590c27488e203351fc808d57ae6bbb79b615d66d27
        - extensionType: as3
          extensionVersion: 3.30.0
          extensionHash: 47cc7bb6962caf356716e7596448336302d1d977715b6147a74a142dc43b391b
extension_services:
    service_operations:
      - extensionType: as3
        type: url
        value: file:///examples/declarations/as3.json
```

## Getting Help

Due to the heavy customization requirements of external cloud resources and BIG-IP configurations in these solutions, F5 does not provide technical support for deploying, customizing, or troubleshooting the templates themselves. However, the various underlying products and components used (for example: [F5 BIG-IP Virtual Edition](https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/), [F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init), [F5 Automation Toolchain](https://www.f5.com/pdf/products/automation-toolchain-overview.pdf) extensions, and [Cloud Failover Extension (CFE)](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-cloud-failover/latest/)) in the solutions located here are F5-supported and capable of being deployed with other orchestration tools. Read more about [Support Policies](https://www.f5.com/company/policies/support-policies). Problems found with the templates deployed as-is should be reported via a GitHub issue.

For help with authoring and support for custom CST2 templates, we recommend engaging F5 Professional Services (PS).
