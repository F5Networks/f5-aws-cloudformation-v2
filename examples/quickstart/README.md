## Introduction

With this solution, you can quickly deploy a BIG-IP and begin exploring the BIG-IP platform in a working full-stack deployment that can pass traffic.

This solution uses a parent template to launch several linked child templates (modules) to create a full example stack for the BIG-IP. The linked templates are in the `examples/modules` directory in this repository. *F5 recommends you clone this repository and modify these templates to fit your use case.*

The modules below create the following resources:

- **Network**: A virtual network (also known as VPC), subnets, internet/NAT gateways, DHCP options, network ACLs, and other network-related resources. 
- **Application**: A generic application for use when demonstrating live traffic through the BIG-IP.
- **Disaggregation** *(DAG/Ingress)*: Resources required to get traffic to the BIG-IP, including AWS Security Groups and Public IP Addresses.
- **BIG-IP**: a BIG-IP instance provisioned with Local Traffic Manager (LTM) and Application Security Manager (ASM). 

By default, this solution creates a single Availability Zone VPC with four subnets, an example Web Application instance and a PAYG BIG-IP instance with three network interfaces (one for management and two for dataplane/application traffic - called external and internal). Application traffic from the Internet traverses an external network interface configured with both public and private IP addresses. Traffic to the application traverses an internal network interface configured with a private IP address.

***DISCLAIMER/WARNING***: To reduce prerequisits and complexity to a bare minimum for evaluation purposes only, this quickstart provides immediate access to the management interface via a Public IP (AWS EIP). At the very *minimum*, configure the **restrictedSrcAddressMgmt** parameter to limit access to your client IP or trusted network. In production deployments, management access should never be directly exposed to the Internet and instead should be accessed via typical managment best practices like jumpboxes/bastion hosts, vpns, etc.

## Prerequisites


- An SSH Key pair in AWS for management access to BIG-IP VE. For more information about creating and/or importing the key pair in AWS, see AWS's ssh key [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html).
- Accepted the EULA for the F5 image in the AWS marketplace. If you have not deployed BIG-IP VE in your environment before, search for F5 in the Marketplace and then click **Accept Software Terms**. This only appears the first time you attempt to launch an F5 image. By default, this solution deploys the [F5 BIG-IP Best 25Mbps](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/F5-Networks-F5-BIG-IP-Virtual-Edition-BEST-PAYG-25/B079C4WR32) images. For more information, see [K14810: Overview of BIG-IP VE license and throughput limits](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K14810).
- The appropriate permission in AWS to launch CloudFormation (CFT) templates. You must be using an IAM user with the AdministratorAccess policy attached and have permission to create the objects contained in this solution. VPCs, Routes, EIPs, EC2 Instances. For details on permissions and all AWS configuration, see AWS's [documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/). 
- Sufficent **EC2 Resources** to deploy this solution. For more information, see AWS's resource limit [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html). *NOTE:* The most likely resource limit to be hit by this solution is for Public IP addresses (AWS EIPs). This solution requires a minimum of two EIP addresses (for Single NIC deployments - one for the External Self-IP and one for an example Virtual Service) or three for Multi-Nic deployments (one for the Management Port, one for the External Self-IP and one for an example Virtual Service). By default, this solution deploys a 3NIC BIG-IP with 3 EIPs. 


## Important Configuration Notes

- By default, this solution creates a username **quickstart** with a **temporary** password set to value of the instance-id **bigIpInstanceId** which is provided in the output of the parent template. **IMPORTANT**: You should change this temporary password immediately following deployment. Alternately, you may remove the quickstart user class from the runtime-init configuration prior to deployment to prevent this user account from being created. See [Changing the BIG-IP Deployment](#changing-the-big-ip-deployment) for more details.

- This solution requires Internet Access for: 
  1. Downloading additional F5 software components used for onboarding and configuring the BIG-IP (via github.com). Internet access is required via the management interface and then via a dataplane interface (ex. external Self-IP) once a default route is configured. See [Overview of Mgmt Routing](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13284) for more details. By default, as a convenience, this solution provisions Public IPs to enable this but in a production environment, outbound access should be provided by a `routed` SNAT service (ex. NAT Gateway, custom firewall, etc). *NOTE: access via web proxy is not currently supported. Other options include 1) hosting the file locally and modifying the runtime-init package url and configuration files to point to local URLs instead or 2) baking them into a custom image, using the [F5 Image Generation Tool](https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/ve-image-gen_index.html).*
  2. Contacting native cloud services (ex. s3.amazonaws.com,ec2.amazonaws.com,etc.) for various cloud integrations: 
    - *Onboarding*:
        - [F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init](https://github.com/f5networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init) - to fetch secrets from native vault services
    - *Operation*:
        - [F5 Application Services 3](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/) - for features like Service Discovery
        - [F5 Telemetry Streaming](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/) - for logging and reporting
        - [Cloud Failover Extension (CFE)](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-cloud-failover/latest/) - for updating ip and routes mappings
      - Additional cloud services like [VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints.html) can be used to address calls to native services traversing the Internet.
  - See [Security](#security) section for more details. 

- This solution template provides an **initial** deployment only for an "infrastructure" use case (meaning that it does not support managing the entire deployment exclusively via the template's "Update-Stack" function). This solution leverages cloud-init to send the instance **user_data**, which is only used to provide an initial BIG-IP configuration and not as the primary configuration API for a long-running platform. Although "Update-Stack" can be used to update some cloud resources, as the BIG-IP configuration needs to align with the cloud resources, like IPs to NICs, updating one without the other can result in inconsistent states, while updating other resources, like the **imageName** or **instanceType**, can trigger an entire instance re-deloyment. For instance, to upgrade software versions, traditional in-place upgrades should be leveraged. See [AskF5 Knowledge Base](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K84554955) and [Changing the BIG-IP Deployment](#changing-the-big-ip-deployment) for more information.

- If you have cloned this repository in order to modify the templates or BIG-IP config files and published to your own location (NOTE: CloudFormation can only reference S3 locations for templates and not generic URLs like from github), you can use the **s3BucketName**, **s3BucketRegion** and **artifactLocation** input parameters to specify the new location of the customized templates and the **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** input parameter to specify the new location of the BIG-IP Runtime-Init config. See main [/examples/README.md](../README.md#cloud-configuration) for more template customization details. See [Changing the BIG-IP Deployment](#changing-the-big-ip-deployment) for more BIG-IP customization details. 

- In this solution, the BIG-IP VE has the [LTM](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) and [ASM](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/application-security-manager-asm) modules enabled to provide advanced traffic management and web application security functionality. 

- This solution has specifically been tested in AWS Commercial Cloud. Additional cloud environments such as AWS China cloud have not yet been tested.

- This template can send non-identifiable statistical information to F5 Networks to help us improve our templates. You can disable this functionality by setting the **autoPhonehome** system class property value to false in the F5 Declarative Onboarding declaration. See [Sending statistical information to F5](#sending-statistical-information-to-f5).

- See [trouble shooting steps](#troubleshooting-steps) for more details.

## Deploying this Solution

Two options for deploying this solution:
  - Using the [Launch Stack button](#deploying-via-the-aws-launch-stack-button)
  - Using the [AWS CLI](#deploying-via-the-aws-cli)

### Deploying via the AWS Launch Stack button
The easiest way to deploy this CloudFormation template is to use the Launch button.<br>
**Important**: By default, the link takes you to an AWS console set to the us-east-1 region. Select the AWS region (upper right) in which you want to deploy after clicking the Launch Stack button. 

<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=BigIp-Quickstart-Example&templateURL=https://f5-cft-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/f5-aws-cloudformation-v2/v0.0.0.1/examples/quickstart/quickstart.yaml">
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png"/></a>


*Step 1: Specify template* 
  - Click "Next"

*Step 2: Specify stack details* 
  - Fill in the *REQUIRED* parameters. ex.
    - **sshKey**
    - **restrictedSrcAddressMgmt**
    - **restrictedSrcAddressApp**
  - Click "Next"

*Step 3: Configure Stack Options*
  - Click "Next"

*Step 4: Review*
  - Capabilities -> Check "Acknowledgment" Boxes
  - Click "Create Stack"

For next steps, see [Validating the Deployment](#validating-the-deployment).


### Deploying via the AWS CLI]

By default, the templates in this repository are also publicly hosted on S3 at [https://f5-cft-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/f5-aws-cloudformation-v2/[VERSION]/](https://f5-cft-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/f5-aws-cloudformation-v2/). If you want deploy the template using the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html), provide url of the parent template and REQUIRED parameters:

```bash
 aws cloudformation create-stack --region ${REGION} --stack-name ${STACK_NAME} \
  --template-url https://f5-cft-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/f5-aws-cloudformation-v2/v0.0.0.1/examples/quickstart/quickstart.yaml \
  --parameters "ParameterKey=<KEY>,ParameterValue=<VALUE> ParameterKey=<KEY>,ParameterValue=<VALUE>"
```

or with a local parameters file (see `autoscale-parameters.json` example in this directory):
```bash
 aws cloudformation create-stack --region ${REGION} --stack-name ${STACK_NAME} \
  --template-url https://f5-cft-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/f5-aws-cloudformation-v2/v0.0.0.1/examples/quickstart/quickstart.yaml \
  --parameters file://quickstart-parameters.json
```

ex.

```bash
 aws cloudformation create-stack --region us-east-1 --stack-name myQuickstart \
  --template-url https://f5-cft-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/f5-aws-cloudformation-v2/v0.0.0.1/examples/quickstart/quickstart.yaml \
  --parameters "ParameterKey=sshKey,ParameterValue=MY_SSH_KEY_NAME ParameterKey=restrictedSrcAddressMgmt,ParameterValue=55.55.55.55/32 ParameterKey=restrictedSrcAddressApp,ParameterValue=0.0.0.0/0"
```

For next steps, see [Validating the Deployment](#validating-the-deployment).



### Changing the BIG-IP Deployment


You will most likely want or need to change the BIG-IP configuration. This generally involves referencing or customizing a [F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init](https://github.com/f5networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init) configuration file and passing it through the **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** template parameter.

**IMPORTANT**: Any URLs pointing to git **must** use the raw file format (for example, "raw.githubusercontent.com").

F5 has provided the following example configuration files in the `examples/quickstart/bigip-configurations` folder:

- These examples install Automation Tool Chain packages and create WAF-protected services for a PAYG licensed deployment.
  - `runtime-init-conf-1nic-payg.yaml`
  - `runtime-init-conf-2nic-payg.yaml`
  - `runtime-init-conf-3nic-payg.yaml`
- These examples install Automation Tool Chain packages and create WAF-protected services for a BYOL licensed deployment.
  - `runtime-init-conf-1nic-byol.yaml`
  - `runtime-init-conf-2nic-byol.yaml`
  - `runtime-init-conf-3nic-byol.yaml`
- `Rapid_Deployment_Policy_13_1.xml`: This ASM security policy is supported for BIG-IP 13.1 and later.

See [F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init](https://github.com/f5networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init) for more examples.

By default, this solution deploys a 3NIC BIG-IP using the example `runtime-init-conf-3nic-payg.yaml` runtime-init config file.

To deploy a **1NIC** instance:
  1. Update the **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** input parameter to reference a corresponding `1nic` config file (ex. runtime-init-conf-1nic-payg.yaml )
  2. Update the **numNics** input parameter to **1**

To deploy a **2NIC** instance:
  1. Update the **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** input parameter to reference a corresponding `2nic` config file (ex. runtime-init-conf-2nic-payg.yaml )
  2. Update the **numNics** input parameter to **2**


Some changes require republishing/rehosting configuration files (git, s3, etc.). For example:

To deploy a **BYOL** instance:

  1. edit/modify the Declarative Onboarding (DO) declaration in a corresponding `byol` runtime-init config file with the new `regKey` value. 

ex.
```yaml
          My_License:
            class: License
            licenseType: regKey
            regKey: AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCCC-DDDDD-EEEEEEE
```
  2. publish/host the customized runtime-init config file at a location reachable by the BIG-IP at deploy time (for example: git, S3, etc.). 
  3. Update the **bigIpRuntimeInitConfig** input parameter to reference the new URL of the updated configuration.
  4. Update the **licenseType** input parameter to use `byol` or **bigIpCustomImageId** input parameter to a valid byol image.


In order deploy additional virtual services:

For illustration purposes, this solution pre-provisions IP addresses needed for an example virtual service and the runtime-init configurations contain an AS3 declaration with a virtual service. However, in practice, cloud-init runs once and is typically used for initial provisioning, not as the primary configuration API for a long-running platform. More typically in an infrastructure use case, virtual services are added post initial deployment and involves:
  1. *Cloud* - Provisioning additional IPs on the desired Network Interfaces. ex.
      - [Assigning a Private IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html#ManageMultipleIP)
      - [Allocating a Public IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html#using-instance-addressing-eips-allocating)
      - [Associating a Public IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html#using-instance-addressing-eips-associating)
  2. *BIG-IP* - Creating Virtual Services that match those additional Secondary IPs 
      - ex. updating the [AS3](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/userguide/composing-a-declaration.html) declaration with additional Virtual Services (see **virtualAddresses:**).

*NOTE: For cloud resources, templates can be customized to pre-provision and update addtional resources (ex. various combinations of NICs, IPs, Public IPs, etc). Please see [Getting Help](#getting-help) for more information. For BIG-IP configurations, you can leverage any REST or Automation Tool Chain clients like [Ansible](https://ansible.github.io/workshops/exercises/ansible_f5/3.0-as3-intro/),[Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/F5Networks/bigip/latest/docs/resources/bigip_as3),etc.*

## Validation

This section describes how to validate the template deployment, test the WAF service, and troubleshoot common problems.

### Validating the Deployment

To view the status of the example and module stack deployments in the AWS Console, navigate to CloudFormation->Stacks->***Your stack name***. You should see a series of stacks, including one for the Parent Quickstart template as well as the Network, Application, DAG, BIG-IP nested templates. The creation status for each stack deployment should be "CREATE_COMPLETE".

Expected Deploy time for entire stack =~ 13-15 minutes.

If any of the stacks are in a failed state, proceed to the [Troubleshooting Steps](#troubleshooting-steps) section below.

### Accessing the BIG-IP

From Parent Template Outputs:
  - **Console**: Navigate to CloudFormation->**STACK_NAME**->Outputs
  - **AWS CLI**: 
      ```bash
      aws --region ${REGION} cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name ${STACK_NAME}  --query  "Stacks[0].Outputs" 
      ```

  - Obtain the Instance Id *(will be used for password later)*:
    - **Console**: Navigate to CloudFormation->**STACK_NAME**->Outputs->**bigIpInstanceId** 
    - **AWS CLI**: 
        ```bash
        aws --region ${REGION} cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name ${STACK_NAME} --query  "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='bigIpInstanceId'].OutputValue" --output text
        ```

  - Obtain the IP address of the BIG-IP Mangement Port:
    - **Console**: Navigate to CloudFormation->**STACK_NAME**->Outputs->**bigIpManagementPublicIp** 
    - **AWS CLI**: 
      - Public IPs: 
          ```bash
          aws --region ${REGION} cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name ${STACK_NAME} --query  "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='bigIpManagementPublicIp'].OutputValue" --output text
          ```
      - Private IPs: 
          ```bash 
          aws --region ${REGION} cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name ${STACK_NAME} --query  "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='bigIpManagementPrivateIp'].OutputValue" --output text
          ```

      Or from Instance Id directly:
      - **Console**: Navigate to EC2->Instances->**bigIpInstanceId**->Instance Summary->**Public IPv4 address** or **Private IPv4 address**
      - **AWS CLI**: 
        - Public IPs: 
            ```bash 
            aws --region ${REGION} ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" "Name=instance-id,Values=${bigIpInstanceId}" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[PublicIpAddress]' --output text
            ```
        - Private IPs: 
            ```bash 
            aws --region ${REGION} ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" "Name=instance-id,Values=${bigIpInstanceId}" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[PrivateIpAddress]' --output text
            ```


#### WebUI 
- Open a browser to the Management IP
  - NOTE: By default, the BIG-IP's WebUI starts with a self-signed cert. Follow your browser's instructions for accepting self-signed certs (ex. If using Chrome, click inside the page and type this "thisisunsafe". If using Firefox, click "Advanced" button, Click "Accept Risk and Continue" ).
  - To Login: 
    - username: quickstart
    - password: **bigIpInstanceId** (see above to obtain from template "Outputs")

#### SSH
  - **SSH key authentication**: 
      ```bash
      ssh admin@${IP_ADDRESS_FROM_OUTPUT} -i ${YOUR_PRIVATE_SSH_KEY}
      ```
  - **Password authentication**: 
      ```bash 
      ssh quickstart@${IP_ADDRESS_FROM_OUTPUT}
      ``` 
      at prompt, enter your **bigIpInstanceId** (see above to obtain from template "Outputs")


### Further Exploring

#### WebUI
 - Navigate to Virtual Services 
    - From Drop Down Box named "Partition" *(Upper Right)*
      - Select Partition = `Tenant_1`
    - Navigate to Local Traffic *(Tabs on Left)*
        - Select `Virtual Servers`
          - You should see two Virtual Services (one for HTTP and one for HTTPS). The should show up as Green. Click on them to look at the configuration *(declared in the AS3 declaration)*

#### SSH

  - From tmsh shell, type 'bash' to enter the bash shell
    - Examine BIG-IP configuration via [F5 Automation Toolchain](https://www.f5.com/pdf/products/automation-toolchain-overview.pdf) declarations:
    ```bash
    curl -u admin: http://localhost:8100/mgmt/shared/declarative-onboarding | jq .
    curl -u admin: http://localhost:8100/mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare | jq .
    curl -u admin: http://localhost:8100/mgmt/shared/telemetry/declare | jq . 
    ```
  - Examine the Runtime-Init Config downloaded: 
    ```bash 
    cat /config/cloud/runtime-init.conf
    ```

### Testing the WAF Service

To test the WAF service, perform the following steps:
- Obtain the address of the WAF service:
  - **Console**: Navigate to CloudFormation->**STACK_NAME**->Outputs->**vip1PublicUrl** 
  - **AWS CLI**: 
      ```bash 
      aws --region ${REGION}  cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name ${STACK_NAME} --query  "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='vip1PublicUrl'].OutputValue" --output text
      ```

  - Or from the instance directly
  - **Console**: Navigate to EC2->Instances->${bigIpInstanceId}->Instance Summary->**Public IPv4 address** or **Private IPv4 address**
  - **AWS CLI**: 
    - Public IPs: 
      ```bash 
      aws --region ${REGION} ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" "Name=instance-id,Values=${bigIpInstanceId}" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].NetworkInterfaces' --output text
      ``` 
      Look for the Secondary IP address on the Public/External Subnet NIC 
      ex.
      ```bash 
      aws --region us-east-1 ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" "Name=instance-id,Values=i-0b218faad768207e8" --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].NetworkInterfaces[2].PrivateIpAddresses[1].Association.PublicIp' --output text
      ```

- Verify the application is responding:
  - Paste the IP address in a browser: ```https://${IP_ADDRESS_FROM_OUTPUT}```
      - NOTE: By default, the Virtual Service starts with a self-signed cert. Follow your browsers instructions for accepting self-signed certs (ex. If using Chrome, click inside the page and type this "thisisunsafe". If using Firefox, click "Advanced" button, Click "Accept Risk and Continue", etc. ).
  - Use curl: 
      ```shell
       curl -sko /dev/null -w '%{response_code}\n' https://${IP_ADDRESS_FROM_OUTPUT}
       ```
- Verify the WAF is configured to block illegal requests:
    ```shell
    curl -sk -X DELETE https://${IP_ADDRESS_FROM_OUTPUT}
    ```
  - The response should include a message that the request was blocked, and a reference support ID
    ex.
    ```shell

## Deleting this Solution


### Deleting this Solution using the AWS Console

CloudFormation -> Stacks
  - Select Radio Button to highlight Parent Template
    - Click "Delete" (Upper Right)
      - At confirm pop up "Deleting this stack will delete all stack resources. Resources will be deleted according to their DeletionPolicy. Learn more"
      - Click "Delete Stack"

### Deleting this Solution using the AWS CLI

```bash
 aws cloudformation delete-stack --region ${REGION} --stack-name ${STACK_NAME}
```

## Troubleshooting Steps

There are generally two classes of issues:

1. Stack creation itself failed
2. Resource(s) within the stack failed to deploy

In the even that a template in the stack failed, click on the name of a failed stack and then click `Events`. Check the `Status Reason` column for the failed event for details about the cause. 

**When creating a Github issue for a template, please include as much information as possible from the failed CloudFormation stack events.**

Common deployment failure causes include:
- Required fields were left empty or contained incorrect values (input type mismatch, prohibited characters, etc.) causing template validation failure
- Insufficient permissions to create the deployment or resources created by a deployment (IAM roles, etc.)
- Resource limitations (exceeded limit of IP addresses or compute resources, etc.)
- AWS service issues (service health can be checked from the AWS [Service Health Dashboard](https://status.aws.amazon.com/)

If all stacks were created "successfully" but maybe the BIG-IP or Service is not reachable, then log in to the BIG-IP instance via SSH to confirm BIG-IP deployment was successful (for example, if startup scripts completed as expected on the BIG-IP). To verify BIG-IP deployment, perform the following steps:
- Obtain the IP address of the BIG-IP instance. See instructions [above](#accessing-the-bigip-ip)
- Check startup-script to make sure was installed/interpolated correctly:
  - ```cat /opt/cloud/instance/user-data.txt```
- Check the logs (in order of invocation):
  - cloud-init Logs:
    - */var/log/boot.log*
    - */var/log/cloud-init.log*
    - */var/log/cloud-init-output.log*
  - runtime-init Logs:
    - */var/log/cloud/startup-script.log*: This file contains events that happen prior to execution of f5-bigip-runtime-init. If the files required by the deployment fail to download, for example, you will see those events logged here.
    - */var/log/cloud/bigipRuntimeInit.log*: This file contains events logged by the f5-bigip-runtime-init onboarding utility. If the configuration is invalid causing onboarding to fail, you will see those events logged here. If deployment is successful, you will see an event with the body "All operations completed successfully".
  - Automation Tool Chain Logs:
    - */var/log/restnoded/restnoded.log*: This file contains events logged by the F5 Automation Toolchain components. If an Automation Toolchain declaration fails to deploy, you will see more details for those events logged here.
- *GENERAL LOG TIP*: Search most critical error level errors first (ex. egrep -i err /var/log/<Logname>).

If you are unable to login to the BIG-IP instance, you can navigate to EC2->Instances, select the check box next to the instance you want to troubleshoot, and then click Actions->Monitor and Troubleshoot->**Get System Log** or **Get Instance Screenshot** for potential logging to serial console.

```
aws ec2 get-console-output --region ${REGION}  --instance-id <ID>'
```


## Security

This CloudFormation template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IP system:

- f5-bigip-runtime-init.gz.run: The self-extracting installer for the F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init RPM can be verified against a SHA256 checksum provided as a release asset on the F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init public Github repository, for example: https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init/releases/download/1.2.0/f5-bigip-runtime-init-1.2.0-1.gz.run.sha256.
- F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init: The self-extracting installer script extracts, verifies, and installs the F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init RPM package. Package files are signed by F5 and automatically verified using GPG.
- F5 Automation Toolchain components: F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init downloads, installs, and configures the F5 Automation Toolchain components. Although it is optional, F5 recommends adding the extensionHash field to each extension install operation in the configuration file. The presence of this field triggers verification of the downloaded component package checksum against the provided value. The checksum values are published as release assets on each extension's public Github repository, for example: https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-appsvcs-extension/releases/download/v3.26.0/f5-appsvcs-3.26.0-5.noarch.rpm.sha256

The following configuration file will verify the Declarative Onboarding and Application Services extensions before configuring AS3 from a local file:

```yaml
runtime_parameters: []
extension_packages:
    install_operations:
        - extensionType: do
          extensionVersion: 1.16.0
          extensionHash: 536eccb9dbf40aeabd31e64da8c5354b57d893286ddc6c075ecc9273fcca10a1
        - extensionType: as3
          extensionVersion: 3.23.0
          extensionHash: de615341b91beaed59195dceefc122932580d517600afce1ba8d3770dfe42d28
extension_services:
    service_operations:
      - extensionType: as3
        type: url
        value: file:///examples/declarations/as3.json
```

## Getting Help

Due to the heavy customization requirements of external cloud resources and BIG-IP configurations in these solutions, F5 does not provide technical support for deploying, customizing, or troubleshooting the templates themselves. However, the various underlying products and components used (for example: [F5 BIG-IP Virtual Edition](https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/), [F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init), [F5 Automation Toolchain](https://www.f5.com/pdf/products/automation-toolchain-overview.pdf) extensions, and [Cloud Failover Extension (CFE)](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-cloud-failover/latest/)) in the solutions located here are F5-supported and capable of being deployed with other orchestration tools. Read more about [Support Policies](https://www.f5.com/company/policies/support-policies). Problems found with the templates deployed as-is should be reported via a GitHub issue.

For help with authoring and support for custom CST2 templates, we recommend engaging F5 Professional Services (PS).
