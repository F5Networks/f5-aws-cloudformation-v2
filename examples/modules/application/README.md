## Introduction

This template deploys a simple example application. It launches a CentOS Linux VM used for hosting applications and can be customized to deploy your own startup script:

1) [Cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
2) Bash script


## Prerequisites

- Requires existing network infrastructure and subnet.
- Accept any Marketplace "License/Terms and Conditions" for the [image](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00O7WM7QW) used for the application.

## Important Configuration Notes

- Public IPs will not be provisioned for this template.
- This template downloads and renders custom configs (i.e. cloud-init or bash script) as external files and therefore, the custom configs must be reachable from the Virtual Machine (i.e. routing to any remotely hosted files must be provided for outside of this template).
- Examples of custom configs are provided under the scripts directory.
- This template uses the Linux CentOS 7 as Virtual Machine operational system.
